# OBJECTIVE: </br>
The objective is to build web service which can compare prices and show reviews of video games from various e-commerce web portals and give them a best price.

# DESCRIPTION: </br>
The idea behind building this service is to ease people’s confusion when they buy games from any e-commerce web-site. This service will fetch all the data about games from different web sites and compare price of games and give best price among all of it to customer. This service will also show comments and reviews given by customer on the different web-sites and they can also give reviews and make comments on this web service. It’ll also include feedback section to know whether they find it legit or not. This service can also filter games according to the categories, launch date, popularity of the game and most purchased games. The technologies used in creating primary dashboard are JSP, HTML, JAVA Script and CSS. For backend, Java Servlet and SQL will be used. We will use KIBANA as a secondary dashboard to show statistics in graphical representation. We will be using MYSQL as main database and Elastic Search as a secondary database to show graphical representation in KIBANA. Server will constantly ask client for a data (which will be fetched from MYSQL server and converted into JSON data) stored in elastic search. Client will fetch a data from device, store to elastic search and feed data back to server upon request.
